It happens a lot while during a daily task a user has doubts about the contact record he is working on or sees that information is missing or unknown, but lacks the time to really investigate what is the cause of it.

This tool makes sure a user can add the doubts and unknowns to a contact record in an easy way without being distracted from his job.

This has several advantages:
-Doubts of individual users are collected in the CRM so the person responsible for data quality can harvest the collective knowledge about the quality of the data very easily.
-The Data Quality manager can search contacts with higher doubt level and investigate them
-All users see per contact record what the doubt status is can act on it during working with it.
